# Wikipedia-Scraper

In this project we use libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup and we will take a personâ€™s name as input from the user and then scrape his/her Wikipedia page. All the scraped information will be written in a text file and then saved in the current working directory of the user. 

After storing all the necessary information in paragraphs, we can write it in a text file and save it in the current working directory
